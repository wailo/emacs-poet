The client allows a user to:
 1. Create and publish work to po.et from Emacs.
 2. List and view published works.

 4. Fill the form.
 5. Click on Create claim to publish your work.

** Tips

+ It is possible make a claim on marked region in buffer. Just mark the region before creating a claim.
+ For convenience, API token and the author name can be stored in Emacs init file, then they will be autofilled in the form. This can be done via the Emacs customization menu or in the claim form which has a remember option next to the fields.
